# üîß FIXING CLOUDINARY CREDENTIALS

## üïµÔ∏è ISSUE IDENTIFIED
Your current Cloudinary credentials are either:
- ‚ùå **Expired or Invalid**
- ‚ùå **Test/Placeholder credentials**
- ‚ùå **Wrong API Secret**

Current credentials in your .env:
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=ydjwftm95t
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=233144845846683  
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=yjRTf0_LmJgdTgCFaXRelkb_VIy0
```

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION STEPS

### Step 1: Get Real Cloudinary Credentials
1. Go to [https://cloudinary.com/console](https://cloudinary.com/console)
2. Sign up for a free account (or login if you have one)
3. Copy the **exact** credentials from your dashboard:
   - Cloud name
   - API Key  
   - API Secret

### Step 2: Update Your .env File
Replace the current values in `/coding-jojo-backend/.env`:

```bash
# Replace with YOUR actual Cloudinary credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-actual-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-actual-api-secret
```

### Step 3: Restart the Server
```bash
cd coding-jojo-backend
# Kill the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Again
Try uploading an ID document from your frontend.

## üöÄ TEMPORARY WORKAROUND (FOR TESTING)

If you want to test without Cloudinary temporarily, I can modify the code to skip the Cloudinary upload and just store the local file paths. This will let you test the rest of the verification workflow.

Would you like me to:
1. **A)** Help you get proper Cloudinary credentials, or
2. **B)** Create a temporary bypass for testing?

## üìä EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER FIX

With correct credentials, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Cloudinary upload results: [{ public_id: '...', secure_url: 'https://...' }]
‚úÖ ID documents uploaded successfully
```

Instead of:
```
‚ùå Invalid Signature [signature]. String to sign - '...'
```
