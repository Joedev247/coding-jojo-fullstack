/**
 * RESPONSIVE VERIFICATION STEPS FIX - TESTING GUIDE
 * ================================================
 * 
 * Issue: Instructor verification steps were not displaying properly:
 * - Step 6 (Education Certificate) was cut off/pushed out of container
 * - Steps navigation was not responsive
 * - UI was compressed on mobile devices
 * - justify-between caused uneven spacing with 6 steps
 * 
 * Fixes Applied:
 * 1. Replaced justify-between with proper flexbox spacing
 * 2. Added horizontal scroll for overflow on smaller screens
 * 3. Made steps vertically aligned with titles below circles
 * 4. Added responsive sizing for different screen sizes
 * 5. Improved mobile layout with flex-col/flex-row responsive classes
