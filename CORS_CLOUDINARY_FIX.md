# CORS and Cloudinary File Upload Fix

## Problem Identified
The errors `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE.NotSameOrigin` indicate that:
1. Files were being stored locally instead of on Cloudinary
2. CORS headers weren't properly configured for file serving
3. The `uploadToCloudinary` middleware was a no-op function

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Server.js CORS Configuration
- ✅ Fixed CORS headers for static file serving
- ✅ Added Range headers for video streaming support
- ✅ Added proper CORS preflight handling for uploads directory

### 2. Teacher Routes Cloudinary Integration
- ✅ Replaced dummy `uploadToCloudinary` middleware
- ✅ Added proper CloudinaryStorage configuration for multer
- ✅ Separate storage configs for images and videos
- ✅ Updated routes to use Cloudinary storage directly

### 3. Upload Controllers Fixed
- ✅ `uploadImage` now returns `secure_url` from Cloudinary
- ✅ `uploadVideo` now returns `secure_url` from Cloudinary  
- ✅ Added debug logging to verify URLs
- ✅ Added video thumbnail generation

### 4. Test Endpoint Added
- ✅ `/api/test/cloudinary-test` to verify configuration

## Required Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file has:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=djwftm95t
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=233144845846683
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=jRTf0_LmJgdTgCFaXRelkb_VIy0
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Backend Test
```bash
# Test Cloudinary configuration
curl http://localhost:5000/api/test/cloudinary-test
```

### 2. File Upload Test
```bash
# Test image upload (replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token)
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "image=@path/to/image.jpg" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/teacher/upload/image

# Test video upload  
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "video=@path/to/video.mp4" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/teacher/upload/video
```

### 3. Frontend Verification
Check browser console for:
- No more `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE.NotSameOrigin` errors
- Image/video URLs should contain `res.cloudinary.com`
- Files should display properly

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
❌ GET http://localhost:5000/uploads/tmp/file.mp4 net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE.NotSameOrigin
❌ Images show empty alt attributes
❌ Videos don't load
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Images load from https://res.cloudinary.com/djwftm95t/...
✅ Videos stream from https://res.cloudinary.com/djwftm95t/...
✅ No CORS errors in console
```

## Key Changes Summary

1. **CORS Configuration**: Added proper headers for cross-origin file access
2. **Cloudinary Storage**: Replaced local multer storage with CloudinaryStorage  
3. **Upload Controllers**: Fixed to return `secure_url` instead of local URLs
4. **Route Middleware**: Removed dummy middleware, using Cloudinary directly
5. **Test Endpoints**: Added configuration verification endpoint

## Restart Required
After making these changes, restart your backend server:
```bash
cd coding-jojo-backend
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

The CORS errors should be resolved and files should now be properly uploaded to and served from Cloudinary.
